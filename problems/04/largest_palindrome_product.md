## Problem 04: Largest palindrome product
From prjecteuler.net:
> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Project Euler has stepped it up a notch on me once again. It seems that about half as many people have finished problem 04 compared to problem 01, to the tune of about 478,503 people jumping ship at the time of me writing this. To put that into perspective, the number of people that gave up on Project Euler after 3 problems is larger than the population of Iceland.
