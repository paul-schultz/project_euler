## Project Euler Algorithms 
This is repository where I will be completing the first 50 project euler algorithms using vanilla Javscript and testing them using Jest. For each algorithm I intend to write a test for the problem, work through the problem, find the correct solution, get my test to pass, push to github, then do a quick write up summarizing the components of my algorithm, programming concepts that were utilized, challenges I faced, how I overcame them, and possible real world applications of the algorithm in question. 

My goal for this project is to gain more experience working with algorithms and data structures, Test Driven Development, building and maintaining a large scale Github repository, and to create a portfolio piece that demonstrates proficiency in vanilla JavaScript programming.

Project Rules:
1. Use of StackOverflow is allowed, but only for finding guidance on an individual part of the problem (i.e. most efficient way to check if a number is a palindrome) but not for the overall solution to the problem itself (i.e. Project Eueler problem 4 solution).
