## Project Euler    
This is where I will document my progress in solving Project Euler problems using vanilla Javscript. For each algorithm I intend to write a test for the problem, work through the problem, find a working solution, get my test to pass, push to github, then do a quick write up summarizing the components of my algorithm, programming concepts that were utilized, challenges I faced, how I overcame them, and possible real world applications of the algorithm in question.  

My goal for this project is to gain more experience working with algorithms and data structures, test driven development with Jest, building and maintaining a large scale Github repository, and to create a portfolio piece that demonstrates proficiency in vanilla JavaScript programming.

Inside of the './problems' directory, there will be a module for each problem that will consist of four parts:
1. A worksheet.js file that serves as a notepad for myself while I am working out a solution and then as a reference to look back on while I am completing the final writeup for the problem. This file will contain my initial psuedocode for the problem and give insights into how my brain works at solving problems.

2. A problemName.js file that contains the finished code that will be exported into the test module.

3. A problemName.test.js file that contains the passing tests for the problem.

4. A problem_name.md file that will contain a sometimes brief, sometimes too long summary of the Project Euler problem and the steps that I took to find a solution to it.
